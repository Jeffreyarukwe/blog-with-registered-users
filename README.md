# Project Title

PyBlogr: A Full Stack Blogging Web App

## Overview

PyBlogr is a feature-rich blogging web application developed from scratch, leveraging Python Flask for the backend and front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project encompasses a robust SQL database, specifically PostgreSQL, for efficient storage and retrieval of blog posts, user data, and comments. Security measures include the integration of a secure user authentication and authorization system, ensuring controlled access levels and protection of sensitive information. Additionally, PyBlogr implements RESTful APIs to facilitate smooth communication between the front-end and back-end, enabling dynamic content updates.

## Key Features
